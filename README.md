* Simple and easy task interaction

## 🔗Technologies Used

* HTML – Structure of the application

* CSS – Styling and layout design

* JavaScript – Logic, DOM manipulation and storage.

* Browser LocalStorage – Data persistence

## 🔗Project Structure

* index.html – Main structure of the Todo List app

* style.css – Styling, layout, and responsiveness

* script.js – Core logic and task management functionality

* README.md – Project documentation and usage details

## 🔗How the Application Works

* The user enters a task in the input field and clicks the Add button

* The task is stored as an object with status (completed or pending)

* JavaScript dynamically updates the task list without reloading the page

* Users can mark tasks as completed, edit them, or delete them

* Task data is saved in browser localStorage and loaded automatically on refresh

* The application shows live date and time and updates the UI accordingly

## Example Inputs

* Complete assignment

* Buy groceries

* Prepare for review

* Practice coding

## 🔗API / Configuration

* No external APIs are used in this application

* The project works entirely on client-side technologies

* Browser Web APIs such as:

    * DOM API for dynamic content updates

    * LocalStorage API for storing and retrieving tasks

    * Date and Time API for displaying current date and time

* All API interactions are handled internally within the browser.
  
## 🔗Learning Outcomes

* Improved understanding of DOM manipulation

* Learned how to store and retrieve data using localStorage

* Gained experience in combining UI and logic features

* Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills

* Built a complete front-end project independently
  
## 🔗Future Enhancements
